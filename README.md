# Dynamic Learning Summary Tool (DLT)
🚀 Overview

The Dynamic Learning Summary Tool (DLT) is an AI-powered educational application that transforms static learning documents into an interactive learning experience. Instead of generating simple summaries, the system analyzes a user-uploaded document and produces five unique, complex, concept-based questions. The user then answers one question and receives single-turn, structured feedback generated by Google’s Gemini API.
This creates a dynamic learning loop that promotes deep understanding, critical thinking, and reflection.

🎯 Key Features
📄 Upload large text documents (.txt)
🧠 Automatically generates 5 high-level conceptual questions
🧪 Single-turn answer evaluation with:

Accuracy score
Strengths
Gaps or misconceptions
Improvement suggestion
🤖 Powered by Google Gemini API
⚡ Clean REST-based backend (Node.js + Express)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
